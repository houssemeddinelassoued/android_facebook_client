Aim of this project is to give some basic understanding on how to implement
a facebook client application for Android. This application is made for
testing purposes only and there is no intention on making it work properly on actual
devices. Emulator FTW.

Getting started
===============

1. Get latest [Facebook Android SDK](http://developers.facebook.com/docs/guides/mobile#android) and create a project for it in Eclipse.
2. Download sources for Android Facebook Client and import project
   into Eclipse. This Facebook client utilizes Facebook Android SDK
   and it's required to have it for compilation.

It's maybe easiest done using EGit Eclipse plugin but feel free to use Git client of your choice.

ToDo
====

1. Re-implement image and other network loading.
  - One "static" application wide controller.
  - Containers for Facebook results and data.
